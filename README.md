- These are answers to a Bloc assignment regarding algorithm complexity. 

- The final answers can be viewed via static html in ./src/final/Complexity_Assignment_1.html

- The wasm folder is an attempt to output the main.cpp file as a web assembly binary. It prints the 200 worst-case binary search iternations to the javascript console. 

    - To view the wasm index.html, a local web server must be running (it delivers the wasm binary). 
    - I'll assume the reader knows how to launch a local web server (if not, google it).
