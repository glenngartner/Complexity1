1. An algorithm that has O(1) is a mix-master, and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a hand operated whisk, mixing wet cement, that slowly hardens into a cement-cicle, with a whisk for a stick.

2. The best case scenario for binary search is that the item being searched for is the first item in the search index (ie: the first place you look). That's a complexity of 0(1) . In the case of binary search, where a 50-50 split is used to divide the list, that’s the middle item of the list.

3. The worst case scenario for binary search is a time complexity of O(logN), where the last element in a half is the item you're looking for.

4. The bounded case scenario for binary search is O(logN).

5. See chart

6. The limit of the function as it approaches infinity is infinity.

7. The complexity is O(N^2)

8. !!! See function.

9. !!! See graph.

10. The Big-O of binary search is O(logN)

11. The big-Omega of binary search is O(1)

12. The big-theta of binary search is O(logN)
